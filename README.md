# The-WildStar-Project
Top level repo holding the source code for 'The * Project' (The WildStar Project)

What is The * Project?
Eventually, thoughts are going to have to be digitized. It is the next step in our human - computer relationship. We already have some tools in place to facilitate general control over our devices, like Siri, Hey Google, Alexa e.t.c.
But none of these tools are particularly dev friendly. And, quite frankly, we can write our programming languages better I think!

Introducing the * project, aiming to provide a high level alternative to most programming languages. This is surprisingly easy to implement, but I am not bothered

**What is actually in this git repo:** ... is not fit for you to actually use

This repo contains code used to integrate between things in my personal IOT.
It is used to host a general purpose discord bot, a locally hosted react site, provide the software for a bunch of arduino's and ESP32's, and tools for debugging the IOT
It is not suitable, yet, for people to just use. It is more for my personal reference than general use

I am publishing this publicly mainly so that when some major tech company developes the tech to translate thought into a digital format, I can say I tried and was lazy and distracted
If you are still reading this I don't know why you bother, only a few small libraries to see here
