# I linked this file into my site packages folder with this command line:
# ln -s /path/to/this/repo/The-WildStar-Project/.macros/my-paths.pth /Users/smartguy88-home/path/to/your/site/packages/versions/3.10.3/lib/python3.10/site-packages
# On mac only
# Change the paths to whatever you want
# ln -s command makes a symlink (a pretend file that only links to a real one) that updates real time (which is great!)
